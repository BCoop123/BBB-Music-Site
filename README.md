HTML/CSS<br />
⦁ Create the main UI for the index page and the review page.<br />
⦁ Design and create the CSS for the site.<br />
⦁ Figure out a layout that will be able to store and present the info stored in the JSON file.<br />
⦁ (optional) A drawn-out design (using a tool like Figma or any art program) would be very helpful in having a clear design goal.<br />
<br />
JAVASCRIPT<br />
⦁ Create the code to present data to the user.<br />
⦁ Create a system to transfer the data between pages through URLs.<br />
⦁ Create the code required to format the JSON data, displaying the reviews on the index page and the comments/reviews on the review page.<br />
⦁ Create the code to update the JSON data with new reviews and comments.<br />
<br />
JSON<br />
⦁ Determine what data we will need to take in and display to the user (username, review text, comment text, etc.).<br />
⦁ Create the JSON file using jsonBlob.com as well as a backup which will be stored on GitHub with the other files.<br />
⦁ This will likely be the easiest job so you will be needed to help the html/css guy and the javascript guy as needed.<br />
